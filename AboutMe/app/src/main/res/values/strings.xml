        "Hello, I'm Anyelys. \n\n
        I am interested in Android development and I am practicing layouts, styles, and accessibility.
        In my free time I learn Kotlin, build small projects, and enjoy documenting what I learn.
        This text is long enough to allow scrolling.\n\n

        Skills: Kotlin, Android Studio, Git, XML layouts, Firebase, REST APIs, MVVM Architecture.\n
        Goal: improve best practices and publish my first app on the Play Store.\n\n

        Personal experience: I have been exploring how ViewGroups such as LinearLayout, ConstraintLayout,
        and ScrollView work, and how they combine to create dynamic and user-friendly interfaces.
        I am also learning about Material Design to enhance the usability of my applications.\n\n

        Hobbies: I enjoy reading about new technologies, practicing programming logic, and solving online challenges.
        I also like collaborating with other students and sharing code on GitHub repositories.\n\n

        Future: I plan to expand my knowledge into Jetpack Compose, local databases with Room,
        and cloud service integration. My medium-term goal is to work on a project that positively impacts users.\n\n

        Note: this text is long enough so that you can scroll within the ScrollView
        and see how navigation works in Android. It is a good practice example to distinguish between simple views and view containers."
